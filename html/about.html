    <h3>Intro</h3>
    <p>Hello! My name is Eric Atkinson, and I've nver been good at doing these things.
    I'm a College Senior and soon-to-be grad student in the field of Data Science. This website
    is going to be an active respository for my idle thoughts, projects, and maps. Maybe reading
    through this can give you a window into my psuche? Maybe not that far. Funny to think about though.
    This website is mainly HTML, and would like to keep it as JS-independent as possible. As development
    goes along, however, we'll see how that rule keeps.</p>
